## Project Overview

Introducing **OpenFlow**, the privacy-preserving solution for transparent financial auditing. Using zero-knowledge proofs, OpenFlow enables organizations to publicly verify financial transactions while keeping the identities of donors and recipients confidential. Whether you're managing charitable donations, political campaigns, or welfare payments, OpenFlow ensures transparency without compromising privacy.

## Repository Structure

- **[Front-end Code](https://github.com/yourusername/openflow-frontend)**: This directory contains the source code for the front-end application, including UI components, state management, and API integrations.
- **[Smart Contract Code](https://github.com/yourusername/openflow-contracts)**: This directory includes the smart contract code, written in Solidity, that handles the financial transaction logic and zero-knowledge proof verification.

## How does it work?

OpenFlow uses cutting-edge cryptography to balance transparency and privacy in financial transactions:

- Organizations initiate a financial transaction campaign.
- Donors make contributions that are logged on the blockchain, with identities anonymized.
- Using zero-knowledge proofs, the total funds raised and allocated are verifiable without revealing individual donor information.
- The public can access real-time, transparent reports showing that funds have reached their intended destination, ensuring accountability.

## About

**OpenFlow** is an open-source project developed by [Nicolás Biondini](https://github.com/NicolasBiondini), [Yago Pajariño](https://github.com/yagopajarino), [Alejandro Almaraz](https://github.com/almaraz97), [Nicolás Acosta](https://github.com/NicoAcosta) and [Arturo Beccar-Varela](https://github.com/arturoBeccar). With expertise in blockchain, cryptography, and front-end development, we aim to bring trust and privacy to financial transactions.

## Acknowledgements

OpenFlow was initially developed as part of the [Aleph Crecimiento Hackathon, 2024](https://www.aleph.crecimiento.build/en-aleph-hackathon). We participated in this hackathon through the [PSE Core Program](https://pse.dev/en/programs), where we deepened our knowledge of programmable cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs.

In partnership with [D&D Fundacion](https://ddfundacion.org/), we are committed to solving the transparency and privacy problems that prevent help from reaching those who need it.
